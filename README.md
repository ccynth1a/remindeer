# Remindeer

NOTE: THIS REPOSITORY IS STILL VERY MUCH WORK IN PROGRESS. IT'S PUBLIC SO I CAN SHARE AND COORDINATE WITH MY WIFE WHO'S HELPING ME WITH CSS

# What is Remindeer?

Remindeer is a lightweight reminder application written using Tauri. I'm pretty new to Rust and adore Svelte, so this is my first attempt at a GUI application. For me, other reminder apps have always had way more features than I actually use, a lot of the time I just want a simple title, a date, and an urgency, but I'm forced to fill out a ton of other things. Remindeer JUST has these three things and a daemon, making it quick and easy to write reminders.

# Future Features 

Though this repository is *very* new, I do have a few post-1.0 updates in the pipeline:

- Remindelk: Dark Theme Mode
- Advanced Filtering: Select multiple sort methods at once ("high" urgency tasks to be completed before 2025 for example)

# Contributing

My usual repository rules apply, these are all personal projects, PRs will not be merged. I know my code is crap, that's part of the learning experience. However if you decide to make a PR, I'll have a look at the code and try and implement something similar myself! Criticism is always welcomed.
